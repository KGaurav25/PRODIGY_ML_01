# Prodigy_ML_01

## House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

### Overview

This project develops a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on:

* Square footage (area)
* Number of bedrooms
* Number of bathrooms

The model uses the **Housing Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains details such as house area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and corresponding prices.

---

### Requirements

* Python 3.x

**Libraries Required:**

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn

---

### Installation / Implementation

#### Option 1: Local Machine

Install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option 2: Google Colab

You can also run the project directly on **Google Colab** through a web browser without installing any libraries locally.

---

### Dataset

1. Register or log in to Kaggle.
2. Download the dataset file **Housing.csv** from the following link:
   [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/housing-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/housing-dataset)
3. Place the downloaded file in the project directory.

---

### Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
Houseprice.ipynb
```

(or open it directly in Google Colab)

The notebook performs the following steps:

* Loads and preprocesses the dataset
* Trains a Linear Regression model using the features:

  * `area` (Area in square footage)
  * `bedrooms` (Number of bedrooms)
  * `bathrooms` (Number of bathrooms)
* Predicts house prices (`price`)
* Evaluates model performance using:

  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  * R-squared (R²) score
* Generates predictions for new input data

---

### File Descriptions

* **Houseprice.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab file containing the complete model implementation
* **Housing.csv** – Dataset used for training and testing
* **README.md** – Project documentation including overview, setup instructions, usage details, and file descriptions

---

If you want, I can also:

* Make it **shorter for internship submission**
* Format it for **GitHub Markdown**
* Add a **Results / Output section**
* Add **future improvements**

Just tell me 😊
